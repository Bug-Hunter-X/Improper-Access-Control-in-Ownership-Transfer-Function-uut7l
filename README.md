# Improper Access Control in Dapp Ownership Transfer
This example demonstrates a common vulnerability in decentralized applications (dApps): improper access control in an ownership transfer function.  The provided Solidity code lacks sufficient checks to prevent malicious actors from transferring ownership without authorization.  This can lead to the loss of control over the application and its resources.  The solution demonstrates how to add more robust checks to ensure only the authorized owner can perform this action.

## Vulnerability
The original code only checks if the `msg.sender` is equal to the `owner` variable.  A sophisticated attacker could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in other parts of the application to manipulate the `owner` variable itself, thus gaining unauthorized access to the ownership transfer functionality.

## Solution
The improved solution incorporates more robust checks. It now ensures the `newOwner` address is not the zero address (0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000) which can cause unintended consequences.  In real-world applications, you might need to validate `newOwner` even further to ensure its legitimacy.
